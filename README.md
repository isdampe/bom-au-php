#Fetch data from bom.gov.au with PHP
I need a quick small library for pulling down some json and xml data provided
by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

You'll need to manually find your data links / paths on the Bureau's site.
It's a bare bone library to accommodate what was required on a small project.

Send pull requests at will.

See http://www.bom.gov.au/catalogue/data-feeds.shtml.

###Requirements
PHP 5+ and php-curl.
